						<h2>A little about me:</h2>
						<article>
							<img src="./images/me.jpg" class="circular-square image-left">
							<p>In 2004, I graduated from The Ohio State University with a Bachelor of Arts in Interactive Communications.  Four years later, I went back to school for a Master's of Science in Marketing Communications at Franklin University.  A decade later, I find myself back in the classroom, but this time, I'm learning to communicate with something other than humansâ€¦.</p>
							<p>In May 2017, I heard about <a href="https://www.techelevator.com">Tech Elevator</a>, a coding boot camp that promised to turn me into a jr. software developer in just 14 weeks.  I couldn't enroll fast enough and by January 2018, I was attending my first classes.  It has been the most challenging, fulfilling, and weirdly fun thing I've ever done for myself.  </p>
							<p>I've been working as a software and web developer since mid-2015, but if you'd asked me about going that route in 2014, I couldn't have imagined myself capable of doing all of this "mathy" work. I'd been dabbling in HTML and CSS for years, but saw anything more complex than that as wizardry.</p>
							<p>That's why I love teaching <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/upcoming-events/2018/2/27/women-wine-web-design-columbus">Women, Wine and Web Design</a> in partnership with <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/">Tech Elevator</a>. I've made it my mission to show more women just how creative and interesting this work can be, and that (as a general rule) developers aren't unapproachable supergeniuses, they're just people who learned how to do something new.</p>
